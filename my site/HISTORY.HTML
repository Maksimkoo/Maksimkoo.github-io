            <h2>START OF PRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>   BMW's production of automobiles began in 1928, when the company purchased the Automobilwerk Eisenach car company from Gothaer Waggonfabrik. Eisenach's current model was the Dixi 3/15, a licensed copy of the Austin 7 which had begun production in 1927.In 1932, the BMW 3/20 became the first                           BMW automobile designed entirely by BMW.<p>   It was powered by a four-cylinder engine, which BMW designed based on the Austin 7 engine.The BMW 335 luxury car was produced from 1939 to 1941. It was built using an extended version of the326 chassis with the larger BMW M335 straight-six engine.]</p></p>

            <h2>1959–1968: NEAR BANKRUPTCY AND NEW CLASS</h2>
            <p>    By 1959, BMW was in debt and losing money. The Isetta was selling well but with small profit margins. Their 501-based luxury sedans were not selling well enough to be profitable and were becoming increasingly outdated.   Their 503 coupé and 507 roadster were too expensive to be profitable. The BMW 600, a four-seater based on the Isetta, was selling poorly. <p>The motorcycle market imploded in the mid-1950s with increasing affluence turning Germans away from motorcycles and toward cars.BMW had sold their Allach plant to MAN in 1954. American Motors and the Rootes Group had both tried to acquire BMW.</p></p>
